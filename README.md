# Memo Akten's 'Techno Fan' Workflow

## init

Memo was tasked with creating a programmatically generated visualization process that would be mapped to pre-created video files. 

Memo was provided with many separate video files of individual layers of individual video shots. These separate video files were originially part of a single, large file that was in a final 'content/timeline' stage.
